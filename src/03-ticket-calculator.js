/**
 * calculateTicketPrice()
 * ---------------------
 * Returns the ticket price based on the ticket information supplied to the function. The `ticketInfo` will be in the following shape. See below for more details on each key.
 * const ticketInfo = {
    ticketType: "general",
    entrantType: "child",
    extras: ["movie"],
  };
 *
 * If either the `ticketInfo.ticketType` value or `ticketInfo.entrantType` value is incorrect, or any of the values inside of the `ticketInfo.extras` key is incorrect, an error message should be returned.
 *
 * @param {Object} ticketData - An object containing data about prices to enter the museum. See the `data/tickets.js` file for an example of the input.
 * @param {Object} ticketInfo - An object representing data for a single ticket.
 * @param {string} ticketInfo.ticketType - Represents the type of ticket. Could be any string except the value "extras".
 * @param {string} ticketInfo.entrantType - Represents the type of entrant. Prices change depending on the entrant.
 * @param {string[]} ticketInfo.extras - An array of strings where each string represent a different "extra" that can be added to the ticket. All strings should be keys under the `extras` key in `ticketData`.
 * @returns {number} The cost of the ticket in cents.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *  const ticketInfo = {
      ticketType: "general",
      entrantType: "adult",
      extras: [],
    };
    calculateTicketPrice(tickets, ticketInfo);

 * EXAMPLE:
 *  const ticketInfo = {
      ticketType: "membership",
      entrantType: "child",
      extras: ["movie"],
    };
    calculateTicketPrice(tickets, ticketInfo);
    //> 2500

 * EXAMPLE:
 *  const ticketInfo = {
      ticketType: "general",
      entrantType: "kid", // Incorrect
      extras: ["movie"],
    };
    calculateTicketPrice(tickets, ticketInfo);
    //> "Entrant type 'kid' cannot be found."

/**
 * purchaseTickets()
 * ---------------------
 * Returns a receipt based off of a number of purchase. Each "purchase" maintains the shape from `ticketInfo` in the previous function.
 *
 * Any errors that would occur as a result of incorrect ticket information should be surfaced in the same way it is in the previous function.
 * 
 * NOTE: Pay close attention to the format in the examples below and tests. You will need to have the same format to get the tests to pass.
 *
 * @param {Object} ticketData - An object containing data about prices to enter the museum. See the `data/tickets.js` file for an example of the input.
 * @param {Object[]} purchases - An array of objects. Each object represents a single ticket being purchased.
 * @param {string} purchases[].ticketType - Represents the type of ticket. Could be any string except the value "extras".
 * @param {string} purchases[].entrantType - Represents the type of entrant. Prices change depending on the entrant.
 * @param {string[]} purchases[].extras - An array of strings where each string represent a different "extra" that can be added to the ticket. All strings should be keys under the `extras` key in `ticketData`.
 * @returns {string} A full receipt, with each individual ticket bought and the total.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *  const purchases = [
      {
        ticketType: "general",
        entrantType: "adult",
        extras: ["movie", "terrace"],
